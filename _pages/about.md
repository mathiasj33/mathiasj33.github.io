# Hi there! I'm Mathias.

I am currently pursuing a PhD in Machine Learning at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/) as part of the [EPSRC CDT in Autonomous Intelligent Machines and Systems](https://aims.robots.ox.ac.uk/) and the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/). I am grateful to be supervised by Professor [Alessandro Abate](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/alessandro.abate/home.html).

My research focuses on *instruction following* and *safety* in reinforcement learning (RL). That is, I am interested in how RL agents can learn to follow high-level instructions (e.g. natural or formal language commands) while ensuring that they operate safely and effectively in complex environments. This is a crucial aspect of developing autonomous systems that can interact with humans and the world in a reliable manner.

Previously, I have worked on learning decision trees for explainable and effective controller representation. I also have an interest in logic and knowledge representation, and have worked on integrating formal logical knowledge with learning-based reasoning approaches (e.g. knowledge graph embeddings or graph neural networks). For more details, see my [publications](publications/).
