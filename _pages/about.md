# Hi there! I'm Mathias.

I am currently pursuing a PhD in Machine Learning at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/) as part of the [EPSRC CDT in Autonomous Intelligent Machines and Systems](https://aims.robots.ox.ac.uk/) and the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/). I am grateful to be supervised by Professor [Alessandro Abate](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/alessandro.abate/home.html).

My research is primarily focused on reinforcement learning. In particular, I am interested in developing methods that allow agents to learn from high-level specifications and to generalise to novel tasks, while adhering to safety constraints. My current research focuses on exploiting linear temporal logic (LTL) as a high-level formalism to specify tasks and safety constraints in a reinforcement learning setting.

Previously, I have worked on learning decision trees for explainable and effective controller representation. I also have an interest in logic and knowledge representation, and have worked on integrating formal logical knowledge with learning-based reasoning approaches (i.e. knowledge graph embeddings or graph neural networks). For more details, see my [publications](publications/).
