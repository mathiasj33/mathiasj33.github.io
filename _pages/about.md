# Hi there! I am Mathias.

I am currently pursuing a DPhil in Machine Learning at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/) as part of the [EPSRC CDT in Autonomous Intelligent Machines and Systems](https://aims.robots.ox.ac.uk/) and the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/). I am grateful to be supervised by Professor [Alessandro Abate](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/alessandro.abate/home.html).

My research interests lie in the intersection of machine learning and formal methods. I am particularly interested in using ideas from verification to specify tasks and safety constraints in a reinforcement learning setting. My current project involves training agents that are able to zero-shot generalise to novel tasks specified in linear temporal logic.
